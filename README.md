# GuessTheNumber HTML, CSS y JavaScript
A small number-guessing project.<br>
In this simple game, you have to guess a number that flips up on the page from 1 to 100.<br>
Each guess is marked and counted down using a clock that counts down the time.<br>
When the number is guessed correctly, the clock stops, and the number of guesses, time, and date are displayed in a table below Math.random methods are used to randomly send the number. It also includes links to social media.<br>
